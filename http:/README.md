# Video Recommendation Algorithm

# ðŸŽ¥ Video Recommendation Algorithm Assignment
## Project Overview
This project aims to build a personalized video recommendation system. The system utilizes user interactions (such as views, likes, and ratings) and video metadata (such as categories and tags) to suggest relevant content. The goal is to provide high-quality recommendations while also addressing challenges like cold-start users and trending content.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
## Problem Statement
The recommendation system should:
- Personalize video suggestions based on user preferences and past interactions.
- Handle cold-start problems by recommending trending content to new users.
- Include popular or trending videos in the recommendations to maintain relevance.

Design a recommendation algorithm that suggests videos based on user preferences and engagement patterns. The algorithm will deliver personalized video recommendations by leveraging user interaction data and video metadata obtained via provided APIs.
## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset can be fetched using the following APIs, which provide information on user interactions and video metadata:
- *Base URL*: https://api.socialverseapp.com
### APIs
1. *Get All Viewed Posts of Users*:
   
   {{base_url}}/posts/view?page=1&page_size=1000&resonance_algorithm=resonance_algorithm_cjsvervb7dbhss8bdrj89s44jfjdbsjd0xnjkbvuire8zcjwerui3njfbvsujc5if
   
2. *Get All Liked Posts of Users*:
   
   {{base_url}}/posts/like?page=1&page_size=5&resonance_algorithm=resonance_algorithm_cjsvervb7dbhss8bdrj89s44jfjdbsjd0xnjkbvuire8zcjwerui3njfbvsujc5if
3. *Get All User Ratings*:
   
   {{base_url}}/posts/rating?page=1&page_size=5&resonance_algorithm=resonance_algorithm_cjsvervb7dbhss8bdrj89s44jfjdbsjd0xnjkbvuire8zcjwerui3njfbvsujc5if
   
4. *Get All Posts*:
   
   {{base_url}}/posts/summary/get?page=1&page_size=1000
   
5. *Get All Users*:
   
   {{base_url}}/users/get_all?page=1&page_size=1000
   
### Authorization
For each API request, include the following header:
- *Flic-Token*: "flic_1e01009f9c1a54706f385bcc1993a08fd9647ba8f499572d280654d1c03c47bf"
### Requirements
1. *Personalization:* The recommendation algorithm should make personalized suggestions based on user history and engagement patterns with similar videos.
2. *Cold Start Problem Handling:* Include a mechanism to recommend videos for new users without prior interaction history.
3. *Trending Content:* Account for recent trends and popularity boosts in recommendations.
## ðŸ›  Specific Tasks
## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - Use the APIs provided to retrieve and preprocess video metadata and user interaction data.
   - Handle missing values, normalize data, and create derived features as needed for the recommendation model.
Data is fetched using APIs to retrieve information about user interactions (views, likes, ratings) and video metadata. The data is preprocessed by:
- Normalizing ratings and engagement scores.
- Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
- Extracting features from video metadata (e.g., tags, categories).

### 2. Algorithm Development
   - Develop a recommendation algorithm using approaches such as:
     - *Content-based filtering:* Recommending videos similar to those the user has viewed or liked.
     - *Collaborative filtering:* Leveraging similar user preferences to enhance recommendations.
     - *Hybrid models:* Combining content-based and collaborative filtering for improved accuracy.
   - Justify the model selection and describe how it meets the project goals.
- *Content-Based Filtering*: Videos similar to those a user has interacted with are recommended based on metadata.
 *Collaborative Filtering*: User-based or item-based collaborative filtering is used to recommend videos based on similar users' preferences.
- *Hybrid Model*: Both content-based and collaborative filtering methods are combined for better accuracy.
### 3. Cold Start Problem Handling
For new users, the system recommends popular or trending videos, as these are likely to appeal to a wide range of users.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
   - Implement metrics to measure recommendation quality, such as:
     - *Click-through rate (CTR):* To assess user engagement.
     - *Mean Average Precision (MAP):* For ranking precision in relevance.
   - Summarize results and insights gained from metric evaluations.
### 4. Trending Content
Trending content is identified based on recent popularity and boosted in the recommendation rankings.

### 4. Documentation
   - Provide clear, step-by-step documentation of the approach, model architecture, and key decisions made during development.
   - Discuss any challenges and solutions.
## Evaluation Metrics
- *Click-Through Rate (CTR)*: Measures user engagement with recommended videos.
- *Mean Average Precision (MAP)*: Evaluates the ranking of relevant recommendations.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
## Code Structure
- data_preprocessing.py: Handles data fetching and preprocessing.
- recommendation_model.py: Implements the recommendation algorithms.
- evaluation.py: Contains functions for evaluating the performance of the model.
- main.py: Main script to run the entire process.

1. *Preprocessed Dataset:* A dataset ready for use by the recommendation model.
2. *Codebase:* A well-documented code repository with API calls and recommendation algorithms.
3. *Evaluation Results:* Metrics showing the performance of the recommendation system.
4. *Documentation:* Explanations of the approach, model, and reasoning (README.md file).
5. *Video subbmition:* Explain your work in a video explaination with a small intro of yourself.
## Results and Insights
The model performs well in terms of CTR, with users showing increased engagement with personalized recommendations. The hybrid model improved ranking precision, as measured by MAP.

## ðŸŽ¬ Notes
## Challenges and Solutions
- *Cold-Start Problem*: We addressed this by recommending popular content to new users, ensuring they had relevant videos to watch from the start.
- *Data Imbalance*: To handle data sparsity, we used hybrid models combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering.

- This assignment evaluates your skills in data handling, recommendation design, and performance evaluation.
- Youâ€™re encouraged to explore additional features if they could enhance the recommendation quality.
